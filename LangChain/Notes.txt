LangChain Chaining Tutorial Notebook -

Below is the comprehensive guide covering LangChain chaining techniques:

1. SimpleSequentialChain - Basic sequential chaining where one chain's output feeds into the next (e.g., generate company name → create tagline)
2. SequentialChain - Advanced chaining with multiple inputs/outputs across steps (e.g., play synopsis generation → review writing)
3. Router Chains - Dynamic routing to different specialized chains based on input content (physics/math/history question routing)
4. LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) - Modern pipe-based chaining syntax for cleaner, more Pythonic code
5. Parallel Execution - Running multiple chains simultaneously and combining results (pros/cons analysis)

Prerequisites: langchain, langchain-openai, langchain-community
Requirements: OpenAI API key
