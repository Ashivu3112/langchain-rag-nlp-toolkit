Pine cone is vector data base store. It is used to store vector embeddings.
These vector embeddings can be used to retrieve the desired data or query

Follow the steps below to upload vector embeddings in pinecone

1. First we need to create an index on pinecone server to store records.
2. Create a pinecone api key
3. Connect to pinecone server through pinceone api key
4. create vector embeddings of the data using any of the models.
5. The dimensions of the embedding model's should match with the pinecone index's dimensions
6. The vector database expects data mostly in a tuple format for better retrival
7. format : vectors_to_upsert = (id: str, embeddings : list, metadata: str | list[str] )
8. Once formatting is properly done, we can upload the data to the pinecone using index.upsert(vectors = vectors_to_upsert)
9. query = index.query(query_embedding, top_k = 10) is used to retrive the query using semantic search

Note:
Delete an index also deletes all the records stored in the index
